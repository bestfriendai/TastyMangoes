# Cursor Rules for TastyMangoes Project

## File Header Requirements

**CRITICAL**: When creating or modifying ANY file in this project, ALWAYS prepend a standard header at the very top of the file with this exact format:

```
//  <FileName>
//  Created automatically by Cursor Assistant
//  Created on: <current local date> at <current local time> (America/Los_Angeles - Pacific Time)
//  Notes: <brief synopsis of what we're trying to fix/implement with this build>
```

### Header Format Rules:
1. Replace `<FileName>` with the actual name of the file being generated/modified
2. Always use the current date and time in the **America/Los_Angeles** timezone (IANA identifier). This will automatically reflect PST or PDT depending on the date, correctly handling daylight saving time transitions.
3. Replace `<brief synopsis...>` with a concise description of what the file is for or what issue/feature it addresses
4. Apply this rule to ALL file types: Swift files, JSON files, Markdown files, configuration files, etc.
5. Only skip this header if the user explicitly says otherwise

### Example:
```
//  MoviePageView.swift
//  Created automatically by Cursor Assistant
//  Created on: 2025-01-15 at 14:30 (America/Los_Angeles - Pacific Time)
//  Notes: Fixed horizontal section bar to remain pinned at top while scrolling
```

**Note:** The timezone `America/Los_Angeles` automatically handles PST (Pacific Standard Time) and PDT (Pacific Daylight Time) transitions, so timestamps will correctly reflect the current Pacific Time regardless of daylight saving time.

This header must be the FIRST thing in every file, before any imports, package declarations, or other code.
