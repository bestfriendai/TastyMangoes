Fix compilation errors after UnifiedMovieCard revert

- Fixed SemanticSearchViewModel: Changed searchService.search() to searchService.newSearch() to use public API
- Fixed SemanticSearchView: Removed all references to searchType property that was removed during revert
- Restored selectedChip property in SemanticSearchViewModel for refinement chip loading feedback
- Fixed indentation and structure in SemanticSearchView after removing conditional searchType logic
- Simplified SemanticSearchView to semantic-only UI (removed direct search conditional branches)

All compilation errors resolved. App should build and run successfully.
