feat: Implement AI-powered semantic search with Mango's personality

Adds complete semantic search feature that enables natural language movie discovery with personalized AI recommendations, voice interaction, and user-specific movie reasons.

## Core Features

### Semantic Search Integration
- Created semantic-search Edge Function using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent movie recommendations
- Generates personalized mangoReason for each movie explaining why it matches the query
- Returns refinement chips for follow-up searches
- Supports session context and user preferences

### Voice Integration
- Routes voice queries from "Talk to Mango" to semantic search (replaces old hint-based search)
- Prevents duplicate processing by skipping VoiceIntentRouter when semantic search callback is provided
- Integrated MangoVoiceManager for Text-to-Speech with Irish accent
- Voice responses speak Mango's recommendations naturally

### User-Specific Movie Reasons
- Created user_movie_reasons table to store personalized recommendations per user
- Reasons are saved when user searches and displayed on movie detail pages
- Each user sees only their own reasons (RLS policies)
- Reasons appear in "MANGO'S TIPS" section on MoviePageView

### UI Components
- SemanticSearchView: Main search interface with search bar, results, and refinement chips
- SemanticMovieCard: Displays movie results with mangoReason, match strength badges, and scores
- RefinementChipsView: Horizontal scrollable chips for refining searches
- Back button: Navigate back through search history (up to 5 previous searches)

## Fixes & Improvements

### Search Refinement
- Smart query combining: refinement chips properly combine with original query
- Maintains original intent when refining (e.g., "war movies" + "based on true stories")
- Enhanced Edge Function prompt to better handle refinement queries

### Display Fixes
- Rating format: Shows "7.1" instead of "7" (changed from %.0f to %.1f)
- Poster display: Loading movies now show TMDB posters instead of infinite shimmer
- Score display: Shows TMDB scores for loading movies, AI scores for ready movies
- Error handling: Better error messages and UI states

### Performance & UX
- Prevents duplicate searches and overlapping TTS
- Search history for back navigation
- Loading indicators and shimmer effects
- Empty states with helpful suggestions

## Technical Changes

### Backend
- New Edge Function: supabase/functions/semantic-search/index.ts
- New migration: 024_create_user_movie_reasons_table.sql
- Fetches TMDB posters and scores in parallel for movies not in database
- Saves user-specific reasons to database with session tracking

### Frontend
- Modified TabBarView to show SemanticSearchView after voice input
- Updated MangoListeningView to support semantic search callback
- Added skipAutoProcessing flag to SpeechRecognizer to prevent duplicate processing
- Enhanced SemanticSearchViewModel with search history and refinement logic
- Updated MovieDetailViewModel to fetch and display user-specific mangoReason

### Models
- Added MoviePreview with posterPath and voteAverage
- Enhanced SemanticMovie with proper status handling
- Session context tracking for better recommendations
