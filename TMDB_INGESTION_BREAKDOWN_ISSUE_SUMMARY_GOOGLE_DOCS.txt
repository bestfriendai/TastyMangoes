TMDB Movie Ingestion Breakdown Dashboard Issue - Detailed Summary

================================================================================
WHAT WE WANT
================================================================================

The user wants to see a "Movie Ingestion API Call Breakdown" table in the TMDB Stats v4 dashboard that displays:

• Per-movie breakdown of the 8-10 TMDB API calls made during each movie ingestion
• Columns showing counts for each API call type:
  - Details (/movie/{id})
  - Credits (/movie/{id}/credits)
  - Videos (/movie/{id}/videos)
  - Similar (/movie/{id}/similar)
  - Release Dates (/movie/{id}/release_dates)
  - Images (/movie/{id}/images)
  - Keywords (/movie/{id}/keywords)
  - Watch Providers (/movie/{id}/watch/providers)
  - Other endpoints
• Additional metrics: Total calls per movie, average response time, errors, last call timestamp
• Data source: Should include ALL movies ingested (scheduled ingestion, manual ingestion, voice search ingestion, etc.)


================================================================================
CURRENT STATE
================================================================================

Dashboard Display
• Location: TMDB Stats v4 → "TMDB API Call Analytics v4" section
• Current Status: The "Movie Ingestion API Call Breakdown" section shows:
  - Message: "No movie ingestion data found. Try adjusting the time range filter or ensure movies have been ingested recently."
  - The table is empty (no rows displayed)

Console Logs
The browser console shows debug logs indicating the filtering logic is running but finding zero matches:
• 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] Total logs: 33 (or similar number)
• 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] Logs with movie endpoints: 0 ⚠️ THIS IS THE PROBLEM
• 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] Grouped into 0 movies ⚠️ NO MOVIES GROUPED

Data Available
• Total API Calls: 33 (visible in dashboard stats)
• Endpoints: 4 unique endpoints found
• Edge Functions: 2 edge functions found
• Time Range: Set to "Last 7 Days"
• Recent API Calls Table: Shows individual API logs, but the breakdown table is empty


================================================================================
WHAT HAS BEEN TRIED
================================================================================

Attempt 1: Regex Pattern Fix

Problem Identified: The regex pattern /\/movie\/\d+/ was not matching endpoints with the /3/ API version prefix.

Fix Applied: Updated three regex patterns in TMDBAPIAnalytics.tsx:

1. Line ~249 - Movie endpoint filter:
   
   BEFORE:
   return endpoint.match(/\/movie\/\d+/) // Any endpoint with /movie/{id}
   
   AFTER:
   return endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/\d+/) // Matches both /movie/{id} and /3/movie/{id}

2. Line ~269 - TMDB ID extraction:
   
   BEFORE:
   const match = endpoint.match(/\/movie\/(\d+)/)
   if (match) {
     tmdbId = match[1]
   }
   
   AFTER:
   const match = endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/(\d+)/)
   if (match) {
     tmdbId = match[2] // Changed to match[2] because /3/ is now capture group 1
   }

3. Line ~280 - isMovieIngestionCall check:
   
   BEFORE:
   endpoint.match(/\/movie\/\d+/) &&
   
   AFTER:
   endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/\d+/) &&

Result: Changes were applied successfully, but the issue persists. Console still shows "Logs with movie endpoints: 0".


Attempt 2: Debug Logging

Added extensive console logging to diagnose the issue:
• Logs total number of logs fetched
• Logs all unique endpoints found
• Logs sample of first 5 logs
• Logs count of logs matching movie endpoint pattern
• Logs sample movie endpoints (if any found)
• Logs number of movies grouped

Result: Logs show that the filtering is running but finding zero matches, suggesting either:
• The endpoint format in the database is different than expected
• The filtering logic has additional issues beyond the regex pattern
• The data doesn't exist in the expected format


================================================================================
POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES
================================================================================

1. Endpoint Format Mismatch

Hypothesis: The actual endpoint format in the tmdb_api_logs table might be different than expected.

Possible Formats:
• /3/movie/12345 (with /3/ prefix) ✅ Should now match with our fix
• /movie/12345 (without prefix) ✅ Should match
• /api/v3/movie/12345 (full API path) ❌ Won't match
• movie/12345 (missing leading slash) ❌ Won't match
• https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/12345 (full URL) ❌ Won't match

How to Verify:
• Check the console log: 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] All unique endpoints: [...]
• Expand that log entry to see the actual endpoint formats
• Compare with what the regex expects


2. Data Doesn't Exist in Time Range

Hypothesis: No movies were actually ingested within the "Last 7 Days" time range, or the ingestion calls weren't logged.

Possible Reasons:
• Movies were ingested more than 7 days ago
• The tmdb_api_logs table wasn't logging calls when movies were ingested
• The logging system wasn't set up when movies were ingested
• Edge functions aren't properly logging API calls

How to Verify:
• Check the "Recent API Calls" table - are there any calls with endpoints containing /movie/ and a numeric ID?
• Check if any calls have edge_function: 'ingest-movie'
• Expand the time range to "Last 30 Days" to see if data appears
• Check the database directly with this SQL query:

  SELECT endpoint, edge_function, created_at 
  FROM tmdb_api_logs 
  WHERE endpoint LIKE '%/movie/%' 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 20;


3. Filtering Logic Too Restrictive

Hypothesis: The isMovieIngestionCall condition might be excluding valid ingestion calls.

Current Logic:
const isMovieIngestionCall = tmdbId && 
  endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/\d+/) && 
  !endpoint.includes('/search') && 
  !endpoint.includes('/discover') &&
  !endpoint.includes('/trending') &&
  !endpoint.includes('/popular') &&
  !endpoint.includes('/now_playing')

Potential Issues:
• The tmdbId might be null/undefined even when the endpoint contains a movie ID
• The exclusion list might be too broad (e.g., if an endpoint contains both /movie/12345 and /search in the path)
• The tmdbId extraction might be failing silently

How to Verify:
• Check console logs for "Sample of first 5 logs" - look at the tmdb_id field
• Check if endpoints in the database have tmdb_id populated
• Verify the tmdbId extraction logic is working correctly


4. Edge Function Context Missing

Hypothesis: The tmdb_id field might not be populated in the logs, and the extraction from endpoint is failing.

Current Extraction Logic:
let tmdbId = log.tmdb_id

// If no tmdb_id but endpoint contains a movie ID, extract it
if (!tmdbId && endpoint) {
  const match = endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/(\d+)/)
  if (match) {
    tmdbId = match[2]
  }
}

Potential Issues:
• The regex might not be matching (already fixed, but verify)
• The match[2] might be incorrect if the regex groups are wrong
• The endpoint might have a different structure (e.g., query parameters, fragments)

How to Verify:
• Add more detailed logging around the tmdbId extraction
• Log the actual match result to see what groups are captured
• Check if log.tmdb_id is populated in the database


5. Database Schema/Data Issues

Hypothesis: The tmdb_api_logs table might not have the expected data structure or the data might be malformed.

Potential Issues:
• The endpoint column might store full URLs instead of paths
• The tmdb_id column might not be populated by the logging function
• The edge_function column might have different values than expected
• The data might be stored in a different format (e.g., JSON in a different column)

How to Verify:
• Query the database directly:

  SELECT endpoint, tmdb_id, edge_function, created_at 
  FROM tmdb_api_logs 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 10;

• Check the actual data format in the database
• Verify the logging function (logTMDBCall) is populating fields correctly


6. Normalization Function Interference

Hypothesis: The normalizeEndpoint function might be interfering with the filtering logic.

Current Normalization:
function normalizeEndpoint(endpoint: string): string {
  if (!endpoint) return endpoint
  return endpoint.replace(/(\/3)?\/movie\/(\d+)/g, '/movie/{id}')
}

Potential Issues:
• The normalization happens AFTER filtering, so it shouldn't affect the initial filter
• However, if endpoints are normalized before being stored in the database, the filtering regex won't match
• The normalization might be applied inconsistently

How to Verify:
• Check if endpoints in the database are already normalized (contain {id} instead of actual IDs)
• Verify the normalization is only used for display/grouping, not for filtering


7. Time Range Filter Issue

Hypothesis: The time range filter might be excluding the relevant data.

Current Filter:
switch (timeRange) {
  case "24h":
    startDate = subDays(now, 1)
    break
  case "7d":
    startDate = subDays(now, 7)
    break
  case "30d":
    startDate = subDays(now, 30)
    break
}

Potential Issues:
• The startDate calculation might be incorrect
• The timezone might be causing issues
• The gte filter might be excluding data at the boundary

How to Verify:
• Check the actual startDate value being used in the query
• Verify the timezone handling
• Try removing the time range filter temporarily to see if data appears


8. Component Not Re-rendering

Hypothesis: The component might not be re-rendering after the code changes, or there's a caching issue.

Potential Issues:
• Browser cache showing old JavaScript
• Hot reload not working properly
• Build process not picking up changes
• Component state not updating after data fetch

How to Verify:
• Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
• Check the browser's Network tab to see if new JavaScript is being loaded
• Verify the changes are actually in the compiled code
• Check if the component is re-fetching data after changes


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS FOR DEBUGGING
================================================================================

Step 1: Verify Endpoint Format

1. Open browser console
2. Find the log: 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] All unique endpoints: [...]
3. Expand it to see the actual endpoint formats
4. Compare with what the regex expects


Step 2: Check Database Directly

Run this SQL query in Supabase SQL Editor:

SELECT 
  endpoint,
  tmdb_id,
  edge_function,
  created_at,
  http_status
FROM tmdb_api_logs 
WHERE endpoint LIKE '%/movie/%' 
  OR endpoint LIKE '%movie/%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

This will show:
• The actual endpoint format in the database
• Whether tmdb_id is populated
• Which edge functions are making movie-related calls
• When the calls were made


Step 3: Add More Detailed Logging

Add logging to see exactly what's happening:

// After fetching logs
console.log('🔍 [DEBUG] Sample endpoints:', allLogs.slice(0, 10).map(l => ({
  endpoint: l.endpoint,
  tmdb_id: l.tmdb_id,
  edge_function: l.edge_function,
  matches_regex: l.endpoint?.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/\d+/) ? 'YES' : 'NO'
})))

// In the tmdbId extraction
console.log('🔍 [DEBUG] Extracting tmdbId:', {
  original_tmdb_id: log.tmdb_id,
  endpoint: endpoint,
  match_result: endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/(\d+)/),
  extracted_tmdb_id: match ? match[2] : null
})

// In isMovieIngestionCall
console.log('🔍 [DEBUG] isMovieIngestionCall check:', {
  tmdbId: tmdbId,
  endpoint: endpoint,
  matches_regex: endpoint.match(/(\/3)?\/movie\/\d+/),
  excludes_search: !endpoint.includes('/search'),
  result: isMovieIngestionCall
})


Step 4: Test with Known Data

1. Manually ingest a movie (or trigger scheduled ingestion)
2. Watch the console logs in real-time
3. Verify that the ingestion calls are being logged
4. Check if they match the filtering criteria


Step 5: Simplify the Filter Temporarily

Temporarily simplify the filter to see if ANY movie endpoints are found:

// Simplified version - just check if endpoint contains /movie/ and a number
const movieEndpointLogs = allLogs.filter(log => {
  const endpoint = log.endpoint || ''
  return endpoint.includes('/movie/') && /\d+/.test(endpoint)
})

If this finds logs but the original doesn't, the regex is still the issue.

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX
================================================================================

Once the issue is resolved, the console should show:
• 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] Logs with movie endpoints: X where X > 0
• 🔍 [Movie Ingestion Breakdown] Grouped into X movies where X > 0
• The breakdown table should display rows with:
  - TMDB ID
  - Total Calls (8-10 per movie)
  - Individual endpoint counts (Details, Credits, Videos, etc.)
  - Average response time
  - Error count
  - Last call timestamp


================================================================================
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
================================================================================

• Dashboard: Next.js/React application
• Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
• Edge Functions: Deno/TypeScript
• Logging: All TMDB API calls are logged to tmdb_api_logs table
• Component: TMDBAPIAnalytics.tsx (v4) - comprehensive analytics component with charts and breakdowns


================================================================================
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
================================================================================

1. What is the actual format of endpoints in the tmdb_api_logs table?
2. Are the tmdb_id fields populated in the logs?
3. When were movies last ingested? (to verify time range)
4. Is the logging function (logTMDBCall) being called correctly during ingestion?
5. Are there any errors in the browser console or network tab?
6. Is the component re-rendering after code changes?
